I represent an invoice which a client gets when undergoing an examination. I have the following instance variables:
- status: a single word describing wheter a clinic received payment etc.
- medicalCareList: a list of medical performances 

You can send messages addMedCare: and removeMedCare: to edit the list of medical performances
