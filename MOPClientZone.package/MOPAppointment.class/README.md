I represent a medical visit. I have the following instance variables:
- dateTime: date and time of when I take place
- doctor: doctor responsible for the examination
- invoice: possible charges for medical performances
- patient: client that undergoes the examination
- report: a medical report after the examination

I only have getters and setters :-)
